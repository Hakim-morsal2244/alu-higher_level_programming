# MyList Project

This project contains a class `MyList` that inherits from Python's built-in `list`. 
It includes a method `print_sorted()` that prints the list sorted in ascending order.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- The code should follow PEP8 style guidelines.

## File Structure

- `1-my_list.py`: Contains the `MyList` class.
- `tests/1-my_list.txt`: Contains test cases for the `MyList` class.
